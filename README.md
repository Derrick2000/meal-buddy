## Workplace:

- Everything we need to do is in the [public](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-prep-app/tree/main/public) directory, the rest is the configuration files. Please look over [index.html](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-prep-app/blob/main/public/index.html), this is the main file of this project. And make sure to put your work in correct directories: 
  + [/frontend](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-prep-app/tree/main/public/frontend) 
  + [/backend](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group28/meal-prep-app/tree/main/public/backend)

Please let me know if you have anything question!
